# Mensch Ärger Dich Nicht
A small game made as university project <br/>
Please note that the game as well as the 
documentation is on german right now.

## How to play
[For the general Mensch-Ärger-Dich-Nicht rules click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_%C3%A4rgere_Dich_nicht) <br/>
If it's your turn, click the 'Wuerfeln' button to role the dice. <br/>
If you got a six, choose one of your figures in the home and press <br/>
the 'Bewege' button. After that, you are allowed to roll the dice <br/>
again. You'll have to always free the landing point for each side. <br/>
If you're the first person to have all your figures in your specific <br/>
color stripe in the middle, you win! :)
